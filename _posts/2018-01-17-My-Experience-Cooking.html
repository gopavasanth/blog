The first time I really cooked (excluding Maggi which everyone cooks) was in the holidays after the first semester examinations. During holidays, Vipin sir asked us to cook a few dishes. Though I was reluctant to try cooking on the first go, seeing the pictures uploaded by other foss members in the group, I  wanted to cook as well and hence, tried making stuffed capsicum curry.

The steps given were to first empty the capsicums from inside. Even cutting capsicum was very difficult for me since it was the first time I tried cutting vegetables. After that, I had to make the stuffing. I had to make it using potatoes. It took me a very long time to peel even one potato. So I asked my mother to help me. She showed how to peel the potatoes and how pressure should be applied at the end to make the peeling process easy. With great difficulty, after peeling all the potatoes, I got to know that the potatoes had to be boiled before peeling. So I kept those potatoes aside in the fridge so that my mother could make something else with them after a while.

Now, I had to cook the stuffing. At first, when I heated the pan, I had not noticed that there was some water in the pan. As soon as I added oil, the oil spilt over and I almost burnt myself. After that, I added all the ingredients one by one as given in the recipe. After cooking the stuffing for about half an hour, I stuffed the stuffing into the already emptied capsicums and pan-fried the capsicums until they became golden green in colour.

At last after all the hard work, we sat for lunch. My parents appreciated my work and said that they loved the dish. I loved the dish too. That is when I learnt that not just eating food gives us happiness, even cooking food can give us happiness.
